# Randomness Against Humanity

This project is a simple demonstration that shows what happens when you answer random CAH questions with random CAH answers.

Oh ya, a computerized voice also spits out the result.

## Installation:
This project requires Python (2 or 3) to be installed. To get all other dependencies, run:

`pip install gtts mp3play`

You probably need to stick a `sudo` in front of that on Linux/Mac.

## Usage:

`python cards.py`

Make sure you are wearing headphones unless you know what you're doing. **You've been warned.**

## Licensing:

My code in this project is licensed under the MIT license (do whatever you want with it but don't be evil).

This means that you can (basically) do whatever you want with my code, but you need to be more careful if you want to use the actual card data from CAH.
